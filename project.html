					<h2>Swift Transport Logistics A to Z solutions for all types of cargo.</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Whether you are looking to ship goods, raw materials, heavy machinery, infrastructure parts, or mobile facilities, our project team will find the appropriate means of transport for your cargo <b>(flat-rack, breakbulk, open-top, or standard containers).</b></p>
					<br>
					<p>Special projects are not necessarily loaded as breakbulk on vessels; some cargo can be loaded in open-top or flat rack containers, even if out-of-gauge.</p>
					<br>
					<p><i>Project cargo often involves shipping significant volumes in standard containers that need to be shipped in a specific time frame. We are aware that the planning and coordination of flows are crucial in such projects.</i></p>
					<p>Put your most demanding project cargo needs in the hands of Swift Transport Logistics </p>
